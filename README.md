# Discount Calculator

This project contains a Python script that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. The function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` takes the original price and discount percentage as inputs. It only applies the discount if it is 20% or higher; otherwise, it returns the original price.

## Features

- **Discount Calculation**: The function calculates the final price after applying a discount of 20% or more.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that users enter valid numeric values for the price and discount percentage.
- **User-Friendly Output**: Displays the final price after the discount is applied or the original price if no discount was applied.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python discount_calculator.py
